Welcome to the documentation for AsciiBinder, which is a system for building documentation. Theses docs right here are managed by AsciiBinder, and if you are managing a lot of very similar docs sets for close-but-not-identical software projects, then maybe you'll want to use AsciiBinder, too.

Have a look at the nav bar learn about how easy it is to manage complex docs sets from a single git repository!
